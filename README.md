### Our App

## Objective

Build a full stack web application - OurApp (a social media app) using Node.JS, Express.Js, MongoDB, EJS (Template Engine for server side rendering) and deploying the application to Heroku.

## Project Context

OurApp is a simple real world application where users can write short tweets, follow each other and also chat with each other.

This project is best for those who want to dive deeper into full stack using Nodejs and MongoDB after learning HTML, CSS and JS. Building a full stack application single-handedly is a tough task, but learning and building such applications will help you master your skills.

## Project Stages

I have divided the project based on the stack used:

* HTML, CSS, Bootstrap: Building the UI of the application

* Serving HTML dynamically and use of EJS (template engine)

* Familiarising the NodeJS environment

* ExpressJS: Framework for creating servers.

* MongoDB: Using NoSQL Database.

* Socket.IO: Building live chatting feature

* GitHub: To publish my project.

* Heroku: Deploy the full stack application

## Application

* You can use it among your friends or family and use it as a real world small scale social media application.
